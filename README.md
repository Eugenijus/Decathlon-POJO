# Decathlon-POJO

This homework assignment is still Work in Progress.
The task is about Decathlon competition.

## 1. TASK REQUIREMENTS:

- [x] 1. The input of the Java program is a CSV-like text file (see the attachment).
- [ ] 2. The task is to output an XML file with all athletes in ascending order (1, 2, 3...) of their places, 
- [x] 3. containing all the input data plus **total score** 
- [ ] 4. and the **place** in the competition (in case of equal scores, athletes must share the places, e.g. 3-4 and 3-4 instead of 3 and 4).
- [ ] 5. The **Input** and **output** file names should be provided as parameters to the Java application at the startup.
- [ ] 6. Application should ask for those parameters itself.  
.  
- [ ] 7. It would be great if an XSL file for viewing the produced XML nicely using a web browser is also provided.
- [ ] 8. Be sure to keep the code design simple, but allowing to easily change or add more input sources and/or output file formats.
- [ ] 9. Unit tests for the code are mandatory.
- [ ] 10. No external libraries are allowed in addition to the Java standard API except JUnit.
- [ ] 11. Gradle should be used as building tool.
- [ ] 12. Recommended java version is 7, but not mandatory.
- [ ] 13. Please zip your code together with the project file. Keep in mind that we are going to run both your program and the tests.  
.  
- [ ] 14. It is preferred that IntelliJ is used as IDEA.
- [ ] 15. Try to keep your code as readable as possible. We value code simplicity.
- [ ] 16. Use object-oriented approach with design patterns where applicable.
